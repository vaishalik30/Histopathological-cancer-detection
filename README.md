# Histopathological-cancer-detection
This project user small patches from Histopalological scans to determine if the Cancer has spread from the primary site of origin. The data used for this project is obtained from PatchCamelyon(PCam) benchmark dataset. It consists of 327,680 colour images (96 x 96px) extracted from histopathologic scans of lymph node sections. Each image has an associated binary label to determine if the is a metastatic tissue present.


For this project Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is being applied using TensorFlow. The pre-processing required in a ConvNet is much lower as compared to other classification algorithms which is one of the main reasons for selecting CNNs.
